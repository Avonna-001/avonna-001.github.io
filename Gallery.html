                <h2>Viennese Café</h2>
                <p class="Details">
                    Viennese Café: In the Reading Room is a 1911 color lithograph by Moriz Jung, created during his
                    involvement with the influential Wiener Werkstätte. The work captures the quiet intimacy of café
                    culture in early 20th-century Vienna, where reading, social reflection, and art converged as part of
                    everyday life. Jung’s stylized forms and warm palette reflect the modernist spirit of the period,
                    blending simplicity with refined aesthetic elegance. Now part of the Museum’s Drawings and Prints
                    collection, the piece continues to evoke the cultural rhythms of Vienna’s artistic era.

                <p class="Details">
                    Tale of the Nun Akizuki is a beautifully preserved 17th-century illustrated manuscript from Japan’s
                    Edo period, presented across nine delicately crafted books. Rendered in ink, color, and shimmering
                    gold on paper, the work reflects the refined visual storytelling traditions of the era. The
                    narrative unfolds with grace and expressive detail, capturing the cultural and spiritual
                    sensibilities of Edo-period literature. Now part of the Mary Griggs Burke Collection in the Asian
                    Art department, the piece stands as a testament to Japan’s enduring artistic legacy.<a

                <h2>Fragment</h2>
                <p class="Details">
                    Fragment is a 19th-century printed cotton textile from the Alsace region of France, showcasing the
                    elegance and refinement of European decorative arts of the period. Its carefully arranged motifs and
                    balanced composition highlight the sophistication of textile printing techniques before industrial
                    methods became widespread. Measuring approximately 36 by 24 inches, the piece invites close study of
                    pattern, texture, and craftsmanship. Now housed in the European Sculpture and Decorative Arts
                    department, it survives as both a historical artifact and an artistic expression of everyday
                    beauty.<a href="https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/222513"> See more...</a>
